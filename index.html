        Why group project?
    </h1>

    <p>
        When trying to think about new ideas, develop product, etcetera, group discussions can help participants build upon each other’s suggestions.
When working in groups, members tend to bring varied backgrounds, experiences, and expertise, leading the conversation with a handful with new ideas and solutions. The diversity can lead to more innovative outcomes. People have different experiences, which is why an exchange of ideas will lead to more wisdom and knowledge. 
Coming up with new ideas with some work of brainstorming will be easier while working in groups.
While working independently provides efficiency and independence, group projects offer creativity and the recognition of new viewpoints which otherwise could go unnoticed. Groups provide emotional support of motivation, leading to increase of responsibility in meeting task deadlines.
With more ideas, you will learn how to think and assess of what ideas weights more and what ideas weight less. Two heads are better than one in a lot of situations.
